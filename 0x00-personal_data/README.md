## Personal Data

This project takes the protection of personal data very seriously. Personal data refers to any information that can identify an individual, such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers. Our application implements robust measures to ensure the security and privacy of this data, including encryption for sensitive information, log filtering to obfuscate personally identifiable information (PII), and secure authentication mechanisms. We adhere to best practices and compliance standards to safeguard personal data and maintain user trust.
