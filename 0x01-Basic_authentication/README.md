### Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple and widely used method for verifying users over HTTP. It involves sending a username and password encoded with Base64 as part of the HTTP request header. While easy to implement, it's important to note that Basic Authentication is not inherently secure as the credentials are only encoded, not encrypted. Therefore, it should always be used over HTTPS to protect the credentials from being intercepted in transit.
